About Meadow 
---

Meadow is a simple blogging system based conceptually on the fantastic [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blogging platform. Unlike Ghost, however, Meadow is built in Rails and Angularjs, making it more easily hackable for Ruby developers.

If you are a person who simply wants a nice blogging experience which includes a live [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) editor, I'd highly recommend [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). If you are a Rails developer looking for a modern blogging setup with an editor similar to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), give Meadow a shot.

**NOTE: I have definite plans to make this codebase more generally applicable as a blog, but as of now it is the exact code that is on [my personal site](http://bradley.computer) and therefore contains images and text that wouldn't be appropriate for someone else. There isn't even a 'post' model yet as I'm using this for an index of 'projects'. That said, I am making the sourcecode available now in case anyone is interested in it.**
