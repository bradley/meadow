About Meadow
---

Meadow is a simple blogging system based conceptually on the fantastic [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blogging platform. Unlike Ghost, however, Meadow is built in Rails and Angularjs, making it more easily hackable for Ruby developers.

If you are a person who simply wants a nice blogging experience which includes a live [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) editor, I'd highly recommend [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). If you are a Rails developer looking for a modern blogging setup with an editor similar to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), give Meadow a shot.
